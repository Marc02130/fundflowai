1. Introduction

The Grant Writing Application is a web-based tool designed to streamline the process of preparing grant applications for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). It aims to enhance efficiency for grant writers by offering a structured workflow, AI-assisted content generation, and version control for application sections. As an MVP, this application focuses on delivering core functionalities to simplify grant writing while ensuring compliance with funding organization requirements.

2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the Grant Writing Application is to make grant writing more efficient, less error-prone, and user-friendly for its target audience. Specific objectives include:

Providing an intuitive interface for creating and managing grant applications.
Offering AI-generated content suggestions to save time and enhance the quality of specific sections.
Ensuring compliance with NIH and NSF requirements through predefined section templates.
Enabling version control to track changes and iterations within application sections.
3. User Personas

The application is tailored to the needs of the following key users:

Grant Writer: Experienced in crafting grant proposals, prioritizes efficiency and compliance with funding guidelines.
Researcher: May lack extensive grant writing experience, relies on AI assistance and structured templates for support.
Administrator: Oversees multiple grant applications, requires tools for monitoring progress and status.
4. Features and Functionality

4.1 User Authentication

Sign-Up: Users can create an account with a unique username, valid email address, and strong password.
Requires email verification to activate the account.
Login: Secure login using username/email and password.
Includes a "Forgot Password" option for account recovery.
Session Management: Ensures secure session handling with a logout option.
4.2 Grant Application Creation

Funding Organization Selection: Users choose between NIH or NSF.
Funding Opportunity Selection: A searchable list of specific opportunities tied to the selected organization.
Grant Type Selection: Options such as R01 or R21 for NIH, with default selections where applicable.
Resubmission Indicator: Checkbox to indicate if the application is a resubmission.
Section Configuration:
Automatically populates required sections based on grant type and resubmission status.
Allows users to add optional sections as needed.
4.3 Grant Application View

Metadata Display: Shows application title, description, submitting user, funding opportunity, grant type, and resubmission status.
Includes an "Edit" button to update metadata.
Section Overview: Lists all sections with completion status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed") and "Edit" buttons.
Document Attachments: Users can upload and manage supplementary documents linked to the application.
4.4 Section Editing

Layout:
Two-Column Design (for AI-supported sections):
Left Column: User inputs (e.g., instructions, comments on AI output), completion checkbox, and AI function checkboxes.
Right Column: Displays AI-generated content.
Single-Column Design: Used for sections without AI support.
AI Function Checkboxes (where applicable):
Generate AI text.
AI editor check (spelling and grammar).
AI error check (logic, math, contradictions).
AI requirement check (compliance with grant guidelines).
AI visualization (e.g., charts or diagrams).
Action Buttons:
Send to AI: Triggers AI processing based on selected functions, creating a new version.
Save: Stores changes to user inputs and updates completion status, creating a new version if changes are made.
Next: Moves to the next section in the sequence (disabled on the final section).
Version History: A panel listing previous versions by timestamp, allowing users to load past iterations.
4.5 AI-Assisted Content Generation

Activation: Available for sections with predefined AI prompts.
Process:
Generates content using application description, attachments, and section-specific prompts.
Refines output for spelling, grammar, logical coherence, and compliance with grant requirements.
Storage: Each AI generation is saved as a new version in the database, preserving history.
4.6 Workflow Management

Section Sequence: Sections follow a predefined order for editing.
Progress Tracking: Users mark sections as completed, with updates reflected in the application view.
5. User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX)

Dashboard: Displays an overview of all grant applications with status indicators (e.g., "Draft," "In Progress," "Completed").
Application View: Presents metadata, section list, and attachments in a clear, organized layout.
Section Editor:
Two-column layout facilitates comparison of user inputs and AI suggestions.
AI features are seamlessly integrated with intuitive controls (checkboxes, buttons).
Progress Indicators: Visual cues (e.g., progress bars, checkmarks) show section and application completion status.
Version Navigation: Simple access to past versions via a timestamped history list.
6. Technical Requirements (High-Level)

Platform: Web-based, compatible with modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Security: Implements secure authentication, session management, and data encryption.
AI Integration: Connects to AI models via APIs for content generation and refinement.
Database: Stores user profiles, grant applications, section content, and version history.
Scalability: Supports multiple simultaneous users and applications.
Compliance: Adheres to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
7. Success Criteria

The MVP will be deemed successful if it achieves the following:

Users can create, edit, and manage NIH and NSF grant applications effectively.
AI-generated content reduces time spent on drafting applicable sections and meets quality standards.
The workflow ensures compliance with funding organization requirements.
Version control and progress tracking enhance usability and reliability.
