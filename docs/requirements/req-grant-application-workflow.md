1. Page Initialization

Trigger: The workflow begins when a grant writer clicks "edit" on a specific section from the grant application view page.
Data Fetching:
Retrieve the record from the grant_application_section table using the section’s id.
Fetch related data from the grant_application_section_fields table (e.g., user inputs, AI outputs) for display.
Retrieve section-specific metadata (e.g., prompts, instructions) from the grant_sections table.
2. Display Elements

Always Displayed:
Editable user_instructions from grant_application_section_fields.
Editable is_completed (boolean) from grant_application_section, displayed as a checkbox.
Read-only instructions from grant_sections.
Conditionally Displayed (if ai_generator_prompt exists in grant_sections):
Editable user_comments_on_ai_output from grant_application_section_fields.
Read-only ai_output from grant_application_section_fields.
Checkboxes for AI functions:
Generate AI text (uses ai_generator_prompt).
AI editor (uses ai_editor_prompt).
AI error check (uses ai_error_prompt).
AI requirement check (uses ai_requirements_prompt).
AI visualization (uses ai_visualizations_prompt).
History Panel:
Show a list of previous versions from grant_application_section_fields, ordered by created_at and formatted as YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS.
Clicking a timestamp loads that version’s data into the page for review.
3. Page Layout

Two-Column Design (default when ai_generator_prompt exists):
Left Column:
Editable fields: user_instructions, user_comments_on_ai_output (if applicable).
is_completed checkbox.
AI function checkboxes (if applicable).
Right Column:
Read-only ai_output.
Single-Column Fallback:
If ai_generator_prompt is null, only the left column is displayed.
Right Margin:
History panel with clickable timestamps for version navigation.
4. User Interactions

Editing:
Users can modify user_instructions, user_comments_on_ai_output (if displayed), and toggle is_completed.
AI Processing:
If AI checkboxes are present, users can select one or more AI functions.
A "Send to AI" button triggers processing based on selected functions, generating a new record in grant_application_section_fields with the results.
Saving:
A "Save" button creates a new record in grant_application_section_fields if changes are detected (e.g., updated user_instructions or user_comments_on_ai_output).
The is_completed value is updated in the grant_application_section table.
Navigation:
A "Next" button moves to the next section based on the flow_order field in grant_application_section.
The "Next" button is disabled if the current section is the last in the sequence.
5. Data Management

Versioning:
Each "Save" or "Send to AI" action (with changes) inserts a new record into grant_application_section_fields, preserving the edit history.
Timestamps (created_at) track when each version was created.
Completion Status:
The is_completed field in grant_application_section is updated on save to reflect the checkbox state.
6. Error Handling

Validation:
Ensure required fields (e.g., user_instructions) are non-empty before allowing "Save" or "Send to AI".
User Feedback:
Display success messages after saving or AI processing.
Show error messages if validation fails or if an AI process encounters an issue.
Summary

The Grant Application Workflow enables grant writers to edit sections of a grant application efficiently, with optional AI assistance where configured. The system supports a dynamic layout that adapts to the section’s configuration (via grant_sections), maintains a version history for auditing, and ensures data integrity through structured saving and validation processes. The provided table structure for grant_application_section aligns with these requirements, supporting key fields like is_completed, flow_order, and relationships to other tables.
