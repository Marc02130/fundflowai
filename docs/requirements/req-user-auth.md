Technical Requirements for User Authentication (Login and Sign-Up)
1. User Registration (Sign-Up)

Purpose: Enable users to create an account to access the system.
Requirements:
Sign-Up Interface: Provide a user-friendly form requiring:
Username (must be unique across all users).
Email address (must be unique and valid).
Password (must meet complexity standards, e.g., minimum 8 characters, including letters and numbers).
Input Validation:
Check that the username and email are not already in use.
Validate email format (e.g., using a regular expression like ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$).
Enforce password strength rules and provide feedback to users.
Password Security:
Hash passwords using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) before storage.
Ensure plain-text passwords are never stored or transmitted.
Email Verification:
Send a confirmation email containing a unique, time-limited verification link.
Require users to verify their email before granting access to login.
Error Handling:
Display specific error messages (e.g., "Email already in use" or "Password too weak").
Handle submission failures gracefully with clear user feedback.
2. User Login

Purpose: Allow registered users to securely access their accounts.
Requirements:
Login Interface: Provide a simple form for users to input:
Username or email.
Password.
Credential Verification:
Validate the entered username or email against existing records.
Compare the hashed password with the stored hash to confirm authenticity.
Session Creation:
Upon successful login, generate a session or token (e.g., JSON Web Token - JWT) to track the authenticated state.
Use secure, HTTP-only cookies or another safe storage mechanism for session data.
Failed Login Handling:
Implement rate limiting (e.g., max 5 attempts in 10 minutes) to deter brute-force attacks.
Temporarily lock accounts after excessive failed attempts, notifying the user via email.
Include a "Forgot Password" option linking to a recovery process.
Error Handling:
Return a generic message for failed logins (e.g., "Invalid credentials") to avoid leaking information.
Ensure the interface remains responsive during errors.
3. Session Management

Purpose: Maintain and secure user sessions throughout their interaction with the system.
Requirements:
Session Creation and Maintenance:
Establish a secure session using cookies or tokens with appropriate flags (e.g., Secure, HTTP-only).
Associate each session with a unique identifier tied to the user.
Logout Functionality:
Offer a logout option that immediately terminates the session or invalidates the token.
Clear session data from the client side upon logout.
Session Expiration:
Set a reasonable expiration time (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity).
Allow session renewal during active use (e.g., via sliding expiration).
Error Handling:
Redirect users to the login page with a message (e.g., "Session expired") when a session times out.
Handle invalid or tampered session data by forcing re-authentication.
4. Security Measures

Purpose: Ensure the authentication system is robust against threats and protects user data.
Requirements:
Web Vulnerability Protection:
Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by sanitizing all user inputs and using Content Security Policy (CSP).
Mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) with anti-CSRF tokens on all state-changing requests.
Secure Communication:
Require HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for all interactions to encrypt data in transit.
Password Reset:
Implement a secure password reset process:
Generate a unique, time-limited reset token sent via email.
Allow users to create a new password after token validation.
Ensure reset links expire (e.g., after 1 hour) and are single-use.
Two-Factor Authentication (Optional):
Provide an optional 2FA feature (e.g., via SMS or an authenticator app) for additional security.
Data Protection Compliance:
Adhere to relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR) by:
Allowing users to manage their account data (e.g., update email, delete account).
Providing transparent privacy notices and consent options.
